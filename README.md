# Chat Bot
This is a chat bot based on NLP. 

The model behind learns patterns from a dataset named ```intents.json```. 
The pattern is then used to categorize any user inputs and return appropriate outputs with the help of PyTorch.

To make the chat bot more accessible, I created an application where users can type in inputs and expect resonses from the bot.
